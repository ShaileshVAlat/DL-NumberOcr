Digit Recognition

Overview:
This project implements a digit recognition system using [specify the technology or model you used, e.g., a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), etc.]. The model is trained on the [specify the dataset, e.g., MNIST] dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

Installation:
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ShaileshVAlat/digit-recognition.git
cd digit-recognition

2.Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3.Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Results:
- Accuracy: [Specify the accuracy]
- Confusion Matrix:
- [Include any other relevant results, graphs, or figures]

Usage:
To use the trained model to predict digits on new data:
python scripts/predict.py --image path/to/image.png
